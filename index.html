        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p>I spent my formative years in Kosamba, Gujarat, where I received my early education at Public School Kharod,
            Ankleshwar, from nursery through class 5. Later, I transitioned to Aditya Birla Public School, Kharach, and
            continued my academic journey there until class 8. The pursuit of knowledge led me to Surat, where I
            enrolled in Delhi Public School, Tapi, and completed my secondary education up to class 10.
            <br><br>
            In the pursuit of academic excellence, I decided to specialize in the Science (Mathematics) stream during my
            11th-grade studies. Eager to excel in competitive examinations, I joined the prestigious Allen Institute to
            prepare for the challenging JEE Exam. My association with Allen tuitions commenced in class 9, providing me
            with a strong foundation and valuable insights into the world of mathematics and sciences. This educational
            journey has equipped me with a diverse set of skills and knowledge, laying the groundwork for future
            academic and professional endeavors.</p>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>


        <p>
            
            Embarking on a journey of continuous achievement and excellence, my ventures in diverse fields have shaped my educational odyssey. As a proficient martial artist, I proudly held the esteemed rank of a purple belt in Taekwondo, showcasing my prowess by clinching medals in both kata and kumite competitions. My early years were adorned with a multitude of accolades, including gold in a dance competition during my seventh-grade, demonstrating a multifaceted talent.
            <br><br>
            Adding intellectual feats to my repertoire, I actively participated in the Science Olympiad Foundation (SOF) Olympiads until class 8, consistently earning medals for my commendable performance. The year of class 8 saw me stepping into the tech-savvy arena, as I engaged in the TCS IT Wiz, a prestigious computer and technology quiz competition. The subsequent year witnessed my foray into anchoring, showcasing my versatility and communication skills.
            <br><br>
            In the pursuit of academic excellence, I undertook the Late KVPY exam during class 11, securing an impressive <b>All India Rank of 2000</b>. My commitment to academic prowess continued into class 10, where I achieved an outstanding score of <b>95.6%</b> in the board examinations.
            <br><br>
            The pinnacle of my academic journey was marked by my exceptional performance in the JEE MAINS during class 12, securing an <b>All India Rank 889</b>. I gave JEE ADVANCED and secured<b> All India Rank 3189</b>. Simultaneously, I achieved a remarkable <b>93.4%</b> in the class 12 board examinations, affirming my commitment to both intellectual and academic pursuits. These accomplishments stand as a testament to my holistic approach to education and my unwavering dedication to excellence.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>My diverse range of achievements reflects a tapestry of skills that have shaped my educational journey. From the disciplined realm of martial arts, where I proudly attained a purple belt in Taekwondo and garnered medals in kata and kumite competitions, to the creative sphere, clinching a gold medal in dance during my seventh-grade, my multifaceted talents extend beyond traditional academic pursuits.
